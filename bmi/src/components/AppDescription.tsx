                Enter data to know your BMI. Your BMI score can belong to four categories:
                underweight, normal weight, overweight and obese. Note that although BMI
                is a useful tool for indicating health problems, it serves only as an
                orientation. For futher details consult your doctor rather that the
                internet. Remember, your body does not determine the love that you
                deserve.
